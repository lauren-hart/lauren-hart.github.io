                                    A grid-based design is one that works in and around the constraints 
                                    of a row-and-column-based grid system to help keep your content nicely 
                                    aligned. A grid is a series of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines 
                                    that serve as guides to place elements in a design. To put it in simple 
                                    words, grids are a system for creating order among elements in a website.

                                    It is the only way to make websites available to all users no 
                                    matter which type of device is used to view the content. Mobile 
                                    browsing use is rapidly growing and could one day overtake internet browsing.

                                    In HTML it is the tags we use to mark a document up. Creating semantic 
                                    markup is nothing more complicated than understanding the language of 
                                    HTML and using it to create a document that has semantic meaning.
                                </p>

                                    I have learnt how important it is to code, test and refine. 
                                    The most important part is to get the layout correct first before 
                                    customising the website. If you are unsure of anything you can 
                                    always find the answer by searching the web.
