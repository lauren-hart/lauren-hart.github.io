    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>EDA is a course that will equip me with the tools of how to work as a coder rather than learning the actual coding languages. </p>
    
    <h3>What are your impressions? </h3>
    <p>I think it will be an extremely challenging experience, but also an extremely rewarding experience. I think I will get as much out of the course as I put in.</p>

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </h3>
    <p>I enjoy working in teams and with other people therefore I think I will enjoy the pairing aspect of the course. I struggle to ask for help when I am stuck and I have a tendency to spend too long on problems therefore I think I could struggle to keep up with the learning at times. I can also get easily frustrated when I donâ€™t understand something. But I also find when I am around really supportive people who can help keep me on track that I will stay focused.</p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? </h3>
    <p>No, I have read enough articles and watched videos about the course that I had some understanding of what the course was going to entail. I have never thought I would just do the course and float into a job. I understand that is going to be a lot of hard work. </p>

    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h3>
    <p>I am excited. I am excited to meet new people and form strong working and personal relationships with these people. I am excited to learn how to work in a reflective and collaborative way also. I am very nervous at the same time, I am nervous I will drop behind or burnout.  </p>
