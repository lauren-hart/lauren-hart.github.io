    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
    <p>It is a webpage that is designed to work in and around the constraints of a grid system (a series of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines). It creates order among elements in a website.</p>
    
    <h3> Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
    <p>It is the only way to make websites available to all users no matter which type of device is used to view the content. Mobile browsing use is rapidly growing and could one day overtake internet browsing.</p>

    <h3> What is semantic structure?</h3>
    <p>In HTML it is the tags we use to mark a document up. Creating semantic markup is nothing more complicated than understanding the language of HTML and using it to create a document that has semantic meaning.</p>

    <h3>Points of Interest</h3>
    <p>I have learnt how important it is to code, test and refine. The most important part is to get the layout correct first before cusotmising the website. If you are unsure of anything you can always find the answer by searching the web.</p>
