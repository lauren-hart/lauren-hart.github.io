                <p>
                    EDA is a course that will equip me with the tools of how to work as a coder 
                    rather than learning the actual coding languages.

                    <p>
                        I think it will be an extremely challenging experience, but also an extremely 
                        rewarding experience. I think I will get as much out of the course as I put in.

                <div class="col-9">
                    <p>
                        I enjoy working in teams and with other people therefore I think I will enjoy 
                        the pairing aspect of the course. I struggle to ask for help when I am stuck and 
                        I have a tendency to spend too long on problems therefore I think I could struggle 
                        to keep up with the learning at times. I can also get easily frustrated when I 
                        donâ€™t understand something. But I also find when I am around really supportive 
                        people who can help keep me on track that I will stay focused.

                    <p>
                        No, I have read enough articles and watched videos about the course that I had 
                        some understanding of what the course was going to entail. I have never thought 
                        I would just do the course and float into a job. I understand that is going to 
                        be a lot of hard work.

                    <p>
                        I am excited. I am excited to meet new people and form strong working and 
                        personal relationships with these people. I am excited to learn how to work 
                        in a reflective and collaborative way also. I am very nervous at the same 
                        time, I am nervous I will drop behind or burnout.
