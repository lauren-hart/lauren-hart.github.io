                        <p>
                            During my first week and first sprint in phase zero 
                            we were tasked with moving a file  (named after a fruit) 
                            to another location (in a peer's folder) using git hub 
                            and the command line. I tried a handful of times before 
                            admitting that I needed help. I had seen that one of 
                            my peers had already completed the task as they had 
                            completed the task and moved their fruit file into my 
                            folder. I reached out on slack and sent her a message 
                            to ask her for some help. Throughout the problem I was 
                            getting frustrated as I knew it was a simple task and 
                            I shouldn’t have been struggling with it. I knew it would 
                            be something very small that I was missing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I learnt that there is no harm asking your peers 
                            for help. I probably wasted more time than was 
                            necessary trying to figure it out myself when asking 
                            my peer for help took no time at all and she was 
                            more than happy to help me. Turns out it was something 
                            very minor that I was missing.

                        <p>
                            After the first two sprints I had made some good 
                            progress on my html and css pages, however the 
                            code was starting to look quite messy and my css 
                            had quite a few double ups. I sat down for a few 
                            hours and worked on my psuedocoding to try and 
                            break each step down and write comments as to what 
                            I was trying to do. This helped tidy up my code. 
                            Throughout the process it felt very satisfying to 
                            tidy everything and add some order to my code. I 
                            learnt that you should always psuedocode to make 
                            things more readable and easier to edit when necessary.

                                    with this technique yet. I completed the debugging 
                                    activity in this sprint but I will need to go back 
                                    and revisit.

                                    probably use it as my number one technique 
                                    and have found some really helpful resources 
                                    this way. I have found a few short videos 
                                    to help with things also.

                                    but I don't do it very often as quite often I 
                                    am not sure how to word my issue to someone else 
                                    which is something I need to work on.

                                    I haven't used this technique yet for problem 
                                    solving. I have found googling generally answers 
                                    my questions and haven’t felt the need to reach 
                                    out to coaches yet. I think that would be last 
                                    option so I am not taking up someone else's time 
                                    too often.
