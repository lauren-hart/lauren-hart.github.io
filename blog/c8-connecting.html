                    <h4 class="h4-blog">Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I was in a shop the other day looking around, the shopkeeper 
                        started talking to me and asked if I was having a good day. 
                        Usually I might brush them off with a quick response as I assume 
                        the only reason the are asking me about my day is to try 
                        and get a sale out of me.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead I assumed they were genuinely interested in how my day was 
                        going, so I kindly replied explaining that I am currently 
                        studying after quitting my established job. She seemed 
                        Genuinely interested and asked me questions and even said 
                        she admired me for what I was doing. It felt nice to open 
                        up a conversation with someone and treating them as a person 
                        just like me, rather than just a sales person with a hidden agenda.

                    <p>
                        I listened to a friend describe the difficult day he 
                        had at work today. He had a difficult case he was 
                        working on and missed a few important details before 
                        sending a document to the other party involved. He 
                        didn’t mention how it made him feel but I could see 
                        he was feeling like he wasn’t performing and it made 
                        him frustrated. I told him that he shouldn’t let it get 
                        to him and that everyone has days like that and I'm 
                        sure if he asked someone to take him through what he 
                        missed they would be more than happy to help. I tried to 
                        ignore the facts and focus on how it appeared to make 
                        him feel.

                    <p>
                        It was strange thinking about someone you're so close to being 
                        so similar to you. Quite often you don’t think about what they 
                        have been through, which can be quite a selfish way of thinking. 
                        It is empowering to remember that no matter how different you are 
                        To someone, at the end of the day we all want the same thing, 
                        to be happy.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can almost feel a warm feeling arise in your heart when 
                        you visualise the person and wish them to happy.

                        When a relationship ended in my past I was hurt and 
                        angry that I didn't hear from the person after it happened.
                        It felt like they stopped caring completely when they 
                        should have still cared how I was feeling.

                        Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a 
                        monologue.

                    <p>
                        When the relationship ended I didn't contact them to see
                        if they were okay. I really wanted to and it wasn't that I 
                        didn't care it was that I knew it would be harder for them to move on if I 
                        kept in contact in the short term.
