<h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
<p>I tried doing a short meditation on Headspace and I flossed my teeth after watching BJ Fogg's video on starting with tiny habits.  </p>

<h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
<p>I found it interesting that most of the articles focused on small steps. I think that it's important to break big goals down into small steps and celebrate each victory along the way. When you focus on one big goal you can lose focus and motivation as you never feel like you are getting closer to achieving your goals.  </p>

<h3>What worked for you? </h3>
<p>The mediation worked for me. I quite often work myself up and get stressed over little things, the meditation helped slow my mind down and think a bit more rationally.  </p>

<h3>Which will you experiment further with? </h3>
<p>I will definitely continue with the meditation and try different practices each day. I'm looking forward to seeing how it helps me deal with stressful times. I would like to make a list of tiny habits and triggers for them and see how I go with them also.   </p>
