                <p>
                    My most recent boss was very understanding when I went through 
                    some health issues and needed an operation on my sinuses. He 
                    never once made me worry about the workload and organised 
                    cover for all of my work. He made sure I knew that health 
                    was the number one priority over work. In our one on one 
                    conversations he knew that I wasn't overly confident in my 
                    abilities and quite often he opened up about how he never 
                    used to be that confident and that it will come with time. 
                    It made me feel like he was on our side and truly wanted us 
                    to develop rather than only focused on the companies 
                    deadlines and his own agenda.

                <p>
                    I found it easy to visualise when you think of goodness 
                    as white light. It made me think that perhaps we too 
                    easily look for the negatives in situations rather than 
                    seeing the good that is everywhere around us. It felt 
                    quite heartwarming to visualise multiplying goodness.

                    When i visualised myself I felt afterwards that 
                    my suffering wasnt so bad and I could see the bad
                    energy coming out and the good energy going back
                    in. I felt quite powerful and that perhaps doing
                    something small like this could in fact have a 
                    huge impact on trying to take away some of the 
                    suffering for someone.

    <!-- Question 4
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– -->
<div class="container-blog">
    <div class="blog-question">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="twelve columns">
                <h4 class="h4-blog">How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
                    <h5>status</h5>
                    <p>
                        During phase zero, I haven't encountered much
                        weight on status. If anything, it feels like noone 
                        sees themselves as having more importance over 
                        someone else. When asking questions on the slack
                        helpdesk everyone is always so eager to help and 
                        noone ever makes you feel like you underneath them
                        even though they may know more than you do. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the bootcamp I think it will be important
                        to only look at status in reference to yourself.
                        It is easy to look at the teacher or the person 
                        who knows the least in the class and put them into
                        a pecking order, but thinking in this way is not 
                        going to help anything. Focusing on "playing against
                        yourself" will be beneficial as we will be constantly
                        be learning new skills over the next nine weeks 
                        and to compare yourself week on week will activate
                        many status rewards. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>certainty</h5>
                    <p>
                        During phase zero, there have been many uncertain
                        moments. Especially because you are working mainly
                        on your own so you do start to feel uncertain as to
                        whether you are doing it right, or keeping up with 
                        the work. That's why I think it was so important to 
                        keep the lines of communication open and attend
                        the weekly check-ins, check in on Slack often or 
                        ask questions and communicate with everyone through
                        Slack. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During bootcamp, there won't be as much uncertainty,
                        yes we will be unsure of many things but at least
                        we will be certain that we will have a strong network 
                        of people around to help us. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>autonomy</h5>
                    <p>
                        Autonomy is not the stress itself that gets 
                        to you; it’s the feeling of helplessness in the face 
                        of that stress. During phase zero there were a lot 
                        of moments where there was stress and dealing with 
                        that stress was not always easy. At times my first 
                        reaction would be panic. Panic that I wasn't smart
                        enough to be doing this, panic that I won't be able
                        to keep up on the bootcamp, panic that everyone else
                        was moving faster than I was. The key to dealing with
                        the stress was to work through problems and realise
                        that everyone is going through the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During bootcamp I think that feeling of helplessness
                        will be greatly diminished by being part of the group
                        and doing work in pairs with the support of the 
                        tutors.                 
                    </p>
                    <h5>relatedness</h5>
                    <p>
                        Relatedness is the perception of whether another
                        person is a "friend" or "foe". During my experience
                        so far in phase zero, I have never really felt like
                        anyone was a "foe" to begin with. I think the culture
                        of dev academy is definitely one that has instilled
                        that everyone is a "friend" right from the get go. 
                        During the check ins, everyone has been so friendly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During bootcamp I think this will continue and I 
                        get the feeling walking in on the first day will be
                        much of the same. We are all in the same boat and 
                        have bonded (without even meeting each other yet) 
                        over the shared experience of phase zero. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>fairness</h5>
                    <p>
                        I think during bootcamp this will be a key quality
                        to exhibit towards others. I think people will 
                        be generous with their time at the expense
                        of their own progress in order to help someone
                        get up to speed. It's not fair to leave someone
                        lagging feeling hopeless in order for you to fly 
                        way ahead.

<div class="container-blog">

            <div class="twelve columns">
                <h4 class="h4-blog">Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h4>
                    <p>
                        I didn't have anything to difficult to discuss
                        at the present. But I can recall the last difficult
                        conversation I had and how it played out. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was when I resigned from my prior job after
                        I had accepted a place in dev academy. I knew it 
                        wasn't going to go down well as I had only been 
                        with the company for 7 months. I visualised how I
                        thought the conversation would go, in my head
                        i didn't see it ending well. It actually went 
                        better than expected, there was the initial shock
                        but once he had got over that he was able to view
                        it as a great opportunity and was really happy for
                        me. In my head I assumed he would only be thinking
                        about the consequences for him and having to rehire
                        and retrain someone, but he was actually able to 
                        look past that. 
                    </p>

    <!-- Question 6
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– -->
<div class="container-blog">
    <div class="blog-question">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="twelve columns">
                <h4 class="h4-blog">Any other musings?</h4>
                <p>
                    I found the mindful emailing topic hit quite close
                    to home. Quite often I receive an email and 
                    immediately interpret ambiguous emails in a
                    negative way. I know from experience that quite
                    often if you just pick up the phone and talk to 
                    the person, you straight away feel at ease 
                    and things were never as bad as they seem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future I will pick up the phone more 
                    often and try and avoid emailing. If I do have
                    to send an email then I am going to take extra 
                    care and visualise myself on the receiving end 
                    reading it with negative bias.
