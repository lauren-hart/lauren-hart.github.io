                        Emotional intelligence is something that can be taught and with the 
                        right training anyone can do it. <br>
                        Being happy isnâ€™t an emotion, feeling or mood it is a state of being and 
                        comes from having an exceptionally healthy mind.<br>
                        If you label an emotion you are experiencing it will somehow help you 
                        manage that emotion and that every emotion has a correlate in the body.

                        I found it quite difficult to stay focused and my mind kept wandering onto other 
                        thoughts. I had to keep focusing on my breath to keep focused.  I did feel more 
                        calm and relaxed after the two minutes.
